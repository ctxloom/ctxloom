//! The isolation decision table, as a pure read model (plan 5.5, 5.6).
//!
//! Two axes: the workspace (`none | worktree`, from orchestration) and the
//! runtime (`host | container-rootless | container-rootful`, from the agent
//! binding): six combinations. [`decide`] turns what is demanded and what
//! this machine offers into a [`Plan`], or a fatal [`Finding`].
//!
//! The rules, kept exactly:
//!
//! - each step of the degrade chain drops ONE axis, and only the workspace
//!   axis degrades: a worktree that cannot be had falls to the live directory
//!   with a warning;
//! - a container that cannot be served with the DEMANDED ownership is a
//!   fatal isolation finding (exit 21) in BOTH modes: `--degraded` does not
//!   rescue it, and an ownership mismatch is never a substitution of the
//!   other mode;
//! - a container is never dropped to the host (Go 0.7: `--degraded` falls
//!   back to the host for nothing).

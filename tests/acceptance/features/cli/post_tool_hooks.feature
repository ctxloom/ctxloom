Feature: The PostToolUse callbacks — a nudge after the tool call that earns one, and silence after every other

  Two hidden commands ride the host engine's PostToolUse hook, invoked after
  a tool call rather than by a person: `hook tool-reflect` asks the agent to
  say what it learned from a LARGE tool result, and `hook skill-mates` names
  the linked skills a just-completed skill leaves uninvoked this session.

  They share session_hooks.feature's contract: a hook that fails interrupts
  the tool call it rode on, so each always exits 0 and always leaves one JSON
  object on stdout. Exit status therefore proves nothing, and the assertions
  below read the envelope the engine would parse — stdout alone — for WHAT it
  carries. Silence is asserted as a well-formed, empty envelope, which is what
  distinguishes "correctly said nothing" from "emitted nothing at all".

  Background:
    Given an initialized ctxloom project

  Rule: tool-reflect speaks only at or above the size it is given

    # The threshold is the whole decision, so both sides of it are asserted
    # with the SAME flag value: a hook that fired on everything, or on
    # nothing, fails one of the two.
    Scenario: A tool result at the threshold earns the reminder
      When I run "ctxloom hook tool-reflect --min-output-bytes 16" with input:
        """
        {"session_id":"s","hook_event_name":"PostToolUse","tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{},"tool_response":"a result comfortably past sixteen bytes"}
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the hook's additionalContext contains "That tool result was large."

    Scenario: A tool result under the threshold is passed over in silence
      When I run "ctxloom hook tool-reflect --min-output-bytes 4096" with input:
        """
        {"session_id":"s","hook_event_name":"PostToolUse","tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{},"tool_response":"short"}
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the hook's additionalContext is empty

  Rule: skill-mates names a completed skill's uninvoked link-group mates, and nothing else

    # THE EFFECT END TO END: the delivered skill set is resolved the way the
    # session's own assembly resolved it (the default agent's profile over
    # this project's bundles), the link group comes from the skills'
    # `ctxloom:link_id` tags, and "not yet invoked" is read off the session's
    # own transcript — which here holds no Skill call, so the mate is named.
    Scenario: Completing one skill of a linked pair names the other
      Given the project already has the file ".ctxloom/content/bundles/v2/nightly/skills/admit/SKILL.md":
        """

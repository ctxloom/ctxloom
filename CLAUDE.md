# Introduction
Note that this is a port of ctxloom into rust from golang, piece by piece, with architect review of each piece as its ported.

We're starting with the highest risk pieces first and the smallest complete units that can derisk early.

# Working rules

## Tests go in `*.test.rs` files beside the code they test

A source file `foo.rs` keeps its tests in `foo.test.rs` in the same
directory, included at the end of `foo.rs`:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
#[path = "foo.test.rs"]
mod tests;
```

Not inline `mod tests { ... }`, and not a `tests/` directory. The tests stay
beside the code they test, but out of the source file, so reading the code
does not mean reading its tests too.

## Layout: a crate's directory is its role

Every crate lives at `crates/<ring>/<role>/<crate>`. The ring and role are
the architecture; there is no other table of crates.

- `core/wire`: generated prost types.
- `core/domain`: aggregates (decide, apply): the write side.
- `core/read-model`: projectors: the query side.
- `core/ports`: traits the core needs from outside.
- `core/application`: command and query handlers.
- `adapters/driven`: port implementations (stores, clock, git).
- `adapters/driving`: CLI, MCP, gRPC: translation only.
- `root/bin`: binaries, the composition root.

ctxloom-rs produces several binaries, each a crate under
`root/bin` that composes the same core, application and adapters. Below
`root/bin`, a crate is named for its domain or role, never for a binary.

`crates/core/clippy.toml` holds the core's purity rules (no I/O, clock, env,
threads or hash-ordered collections) and reaches every core crate, because
clippy reads the nearest `clippy.toml`. A crate's own `clippy.toml` would
replace it, so none has one. It repeats the root `clippy.toml`'s settings,
and `just lint` refuses to run if they disagree.

## Architecture: hexagonal around CQRS/ES (checked in review)

Dependencies point inward; a review refuses a change that breaks these:

- The core depends on nothing outside it. A domain or read model links only
  annals, annals-diagnostic, prost and angzarr-proto: no I/O, async runtime
  or clock in decide, apply or a projection.
- A driven adapter sees only ports (and wire types), never a use case. A
  driving adapter sees only the application layer, never a domain's
  internals. Adapters never depend on each other.
- A domain never depends on a read model (the write side reads no
  projection); a read model never depends on the application layer (a query
  issues no command).
- Entities are aggregates; anything listed is a projector's read model,
  never an aggregate. A UI watches one stream per watch; a list's cursor is
  its projector's own sequence.

## Generated code is never committed

Wire and domain types are generated into `OUT_DIR` by `angzarr-build` from
`proto/`. A core crate's `build.rs` is one call (`angzarr_build::wire` or
`angzarr_build::domain`): angzarr-build reads the build environment itself,
so the core's clippy rules hold in build scripts too. Change the `.proto`,
never generated output.

## Storage is annals-store-sql, in annals for now

The SQL store is `annals-store-sql` (feature `sqlite`), in the annals
repository: backend-neutral statements, with each backend's execution and
migrations behind a feature. It lives in annals until angzarr core's older
SQL storage is brought onto it, and then moves to angzarr core. ctxloom
writes no SQL of its own; a project's database is that crate's SQLite store,
opened at `~/.ctxloom/projects/<project-id>/state.db`.

Any store is held to annals' store contract (`annals::store_contract!` or
`annals::async_store_contract!`), the checks `InMemoryStore` passes. Domain
and projector tests run through annals' kernel over `InMemoryStore`, as the
daemon runs over SQLite.

## Errors are localizable: a code, args, and an en-US message

Every error and rejection implements `annals_diagnostic::Diagnostic` with an
English `Display` fallback. A new variant needs a stable code (prefixed with
the crate's name), an en-US message in `locales/en-US/<crate>.ftl` using
exactly its args, and a sample in the crate's `diagnostic_samples()`. The
crate's catalog test checks messages and samples both ways.

## Use `just`

`just test`, `just lint` (clippy, warnings denied) and `just lint-deps`
(cargo-deny) are the checks; lefthook's pre-commit runs fmt, gitleaks,
clippy and cargo-deny, then judges the staged change alone: `just
test-staged` tests the changed crates and their dependents, and `just
mutants-staged` mutation-tests the staged diff (`cargo mutants --in-diff`),
holding new logic to its tier: domain and read models 85% or more, adapters
50% or more (the justfile's `mutation_thresholds` has every tier).

Feature: session — the record of what your assistant did, and the tools to prune it

  Every `ctxloom run` mints a harp-named session and writes down what
  happened. The `session` noun is how you read that record back and how you
  throw parts of it away. Reading is free; every destroyer reports first and
  changes nothing until you say `--yes`.

  This is the comprehensive per-noun spec: what the noun DOES, leaf by leaf,
  hermetically against seeded sessions in the session index, which is
  folded from the session events in the project's store: listing, searching
  and showing a session, and its transcript, read those events, never a file
  in the session's directory. The narrative versions — Alice
  recalling a conversation from March, Alice closing a shipped workstream out
  — are journeys/j001200_recall.feature and j001300_closeout.feature, which
  assert what a PERSON sees.

  Surfaces covered here:

    ctxloom session                     (bare: lists)
    ctxloom session list [--state live|ended|unknown]
    ctxloom session show <harp>
    ctxloom session edit <harp> --name <new>
    ctxloom session keep <harp> [--undo]

    ctxloom session ask <harp> "<question>"
    ctxloom session search <word>... [--state live|ended|unknown]
    ctxloom session transcript              (bare: lists)
    ctxloom session transcript list [<harp>]
    ctxloom session transcript show <harp>

    ctxloom session worktrees list [<harp>]
    ctxloom session remove <harp> | --older-than <age> [--yes]
    ctxloom session approvals

  Rule: Reading the record touches nothing

    Scenario: The bare noun lists what has been recorded
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a recorded session "amber-swift-owl"
      When I run "ctxloom session"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "amber-swift-owl"

    Scenario: --all reaches past the current project
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a recorded session "amber-swift-owl"
      When I run "ctxloom session list --all"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "amber-swift-owl"

    # Tabled by format: `session list` is wired to emit(), so off a terminal
    # (which this harness always is) the no-flag row now gets the JSON rows
    # array (empty here), not the "(no sessions)" text line. Reuses the
    # branch's shared empty-collection step rather than a new spelling.
    Scenario Outline: A fresh project has recorded nothing
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When I run "ctxloom <flags> session list"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "$" as empty, saying "no sessions"

      @json-default
      Examples: no --format at all takes the derived default off a terminal; an explicit one wins in both directions
        | flags         |
        |               |
        | --format json |
        | --format text |

    # A session's title is the first thing its user asked, read from its
    # recorded transcript: the listing, the search and `show` all carry it.
    Scenario: Showing a session prints its record, titled by its first prompt
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a recorded session "amber-swift-owl"
      When I run "ctxloom session show amber-swift-owl --format text"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "Seeded prompt for amber-swift-owl."
      And the output contains "engine:"
      When I run "ctxloom session list --format json"
      Then the JSON output array "$" contains an object whose "harp" is "amber-swift-owl" and whose "summary" is "Seeded prompt for amber-swift-owl."

    # The index says ended; the lock says running. The lock wins in the
    # listing too: ended_at is when the LAST run ended and a resume keeps it,
    # so it is no answer to "is this running now". The state is the lock's
    # verdict — held is live, free is ended, no lock file is unknown — and a
    # live session's end is blank rather than a stamp from its previous run.
    Scenario: The listing takes each session's state from its lock, not its end stamp
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a session "amber-swift-owl" with a transcript that is running again
      And a finished session "brisk-copper-moth" with a transcript
      And a finished session "calm-dusty-wren" with a transcript but no session lock
      When I run "ctxloom session list --all --format json"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the JSON output array "$" contains an object whose "harp" is "amber-swift-owl" and whose "state" is "live"
      And the JSON output array "$" contains an object whose "harp" is "amber-swift-owl" and that has no "end"
      And the JSON output array "$" contains an object whose "harp" is "brisk-copper-moth" and whose "state" is "ended"
      And the JSON output array "$" contains an object whose "harp" is "calm-dusty-wren" and whose "state" is "unknown"
      When I run "ctxloom session list --all --format text"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "STATE"

    Scenario Outline: --state keeps only the sessions in that state
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a session "amber-swift-owl" with a transcript that is running again
      And a finished session "brisk-copper-moth" with a transcript
      And a finished session "calm-dusty-wren" with a transcript but no session lock
      When I run "ctxloom session <leaf> --all --state <state> --format json"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the JSON output array "$" contains an object whose "harp" is "<kept>" and whose "state" is "<state>"
      And the JSON output array "$" contains no object whose "harp" is "<dropped1>"
      And the JSON output array "$" contains no object whose "harp" is "<dropped2>"

      Examples: both listings filter the same way
        | leaf           | state   | kept              | dropped1          | dropped2          |
        | list           | live    | amber-swift-owl   | brisk-copper-moth | calm-dusty-wren   |
        | list           | ended   | brisk-copper-moth | amber-swift-owl   | calm-dusty-wren   |
        | list           | unknown | calm-dusty-wren   | amber-swift-owl   | brisk-copper-moth |
        | search seeded  | live    | amber-swift-owl   | brisk-copper-moth | calm-dusty-wren   |
        | search seeded  | ended   | brisk-copper-moth | amber-swift-owl   | calm-dusty-wren   |

    Scenario: --state refuses a word that is not a state
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When I run "ctxloom session list --state running"
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "live, ended, unknown"

    # "Nothing matched" and "the search did not run" must not look the same:
    # an empty result is said in so many words, never answered with no output.
    Scenario: A query that matches nothing says so rather than printing nothing
      # substitution: a recorded session the query does not match stands in for the journey's March fixture.
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a recorded session "amber-swift-owl"
      When I run "ctxloom session search J001200-MATCHES-ABSOLUTELY-NOTHING"
      Then the command succeeds
      And ctxloom says plainly that nothing matched

  Rule: Renaming is a field assignment, so it rides `edit`

    A session's name is a field on its record, not a thing with a verb of
    its own. `edit` is the one mutation verb for the noun, and `--name` is
    the assignment that renames the harp. The backend transcript is
    unaffected: the session keeps its bound session id and its transcript,
    and only the name it answers to moves. Its output folder
    (`<project>/<output.dir>/<harp>`, `ctxloom/` by default, owner rulings
    89, 106) moves with it, to the new name beside the old, and the record
    names where it went; a rename whose folder cannot move is refused whole.

    @json-default
    Scenario: --name renames the harp and moves its output folder
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a finished session "amber-swift-owl" with a transcript and a summary an older ctxloom left
      When I run "ctxloom session edit amber-swift-owl --name bright-keen-hawk"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "bright-keen-hawk"
      And the output file "essence.md" of session "bright-keen-hawk" exists
      And the output file "essence.md" of session "amber-swift-owl" does not exist
      When I run "ctxloom session list --all"
      Then the JSON output array "$" contains an object whose "harp" is "bright-keen-hawk"
      And the JSON output array "$" contains no object whose "harp" is "amber-swift-owl"

    Scenario: The old rename verb is gone, not hidden
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a recorded session "amber-swift-owl"
      When I run "ctxloom session rename amber-swift-owl bright-keen-hawk"
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "unknown command"

    # A session has no authored document. Its index entry is machine-written
    # and its title is DERIVED from its transcript, so an editor round-trip
    # here would offer edits nothing keeps. The bare form says so outright and names the
    # assignment it does take, rather than exiting 0 having changed nothing.
    Scenario: A bare edit refuses, because there is no document to open
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a recorded session "amber-swift-owl"
      When I run "ctxloom session edit amber-swift-owl"
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "no editable document"
      And the output contains "--name"

    Scenario: Editing a session nobody recorded fails
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When I run "ctxloom session edit no-such-harp --name bright-keen-hawk"
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "no-such-harp"

  Rule: The transcript is a population of its own

    A session's recorded conversation has its own listing, its own stream and
    its own destroyer, so it gets its own sub-noun. `session transcript`
    named alone lists — the same bare-noun answer `remote` gives.

    Scenario: The bare sub-noun lists which sessions have a transcript
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a recorded session "amber-swift-owl"
      When I run "ctxloom session transcript"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "amber-swift-owl"

    # A session whose transcript was never captured is listed SAYING SO.
    # Omitting it would make "nothing was captured" read identically to
    # "there are no sessions".
    Scenario: A session with no captured transcript is still named
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a recorded session "amber-swift-owl" for backend "claude-code"
      When I run "ctxloom session transcript list"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "amber-swift-owl"
      And the output contains "false"

    Scenario: The harp is a positional, and an unknown one fails
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When I run "ctxloom session transcript list no-such-harp"
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "no-such-harp"

    # Off a terminal (which this harness always is) show's default is NDJSON:
    # the whole transcript, and nothing else, on stdout, then exit.
    Scenario: Show prints the whole transcript and exits, ready for a pipe
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a recorded session "amber-swift-owl"
      When I run "ctxloom session transcript show amber-swift-owl"
      Then the command succeeds
      And every line of stdout is a JSON object
      And the output contains "Seeded prompt for amber-swift-owl."

    Scenario: Watching moved under the transcript it watches
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a recorded session "amber-swift-owl"
      When I run "ctxloom session watch amber-swift-owl"
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "unknown command"

  Rule: Pending approvals are readable from any terminal, and only readable

    # `session approvals` asks every live coordinator on this host, found by
    # the endpoint files coordinators write under the state root. With none
    # running nothing is parked anywhere, so that is a message naming where
    # discovery looked, not a failure; the structured form says how many
    # coordinators answered, which is what separates "none running" from
    # "running with nothing pending".
    Scenario: With no coordinator running, the text says so and where it looked
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When I run "ctxloom --format text session approvals"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "no coordinator is running"
      And the output contains "no live endpoint under"

    Scenario: With no coordinator running, the JSON reports none answered and nothing pending
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When I run "ctxloom --format json session approvals"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "coordinators" as "0"
      And the output reports "approvals" as empty, saying "no coordinator is running"

    # A SECOND PROCESS reaching a LIVE coordinator: the standing owner is a
    # real `ctxloom run` hosting one, and this command finds it by discovery
    # and asks it over RPC. "coordinators" is 1 only because that round trip
    # happened. The owner is interactive and routes no approvals, so nothing
    # is parked — a request parked by a headless child is not staged here:
    # nothing in this harness can wait on another process's queue without
    # polling it. That proof is the integration lane's
    # TestPermissionContract_AnotherProcessListsTheParkedAsk.
    Scenario: Another terminal reaches the running session's coordinator and finds nothing parked
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a session owner is standing
      When I run "ctxloom --format json session approvals"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "coordinators" as "1"
      And the output reports "approvals" as empty, saying "no pending approvals"
      When I run "ctxloom --format text session approvals"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "no pending approvals"

    # The command only lists: there is no argument that names a request to
    # answer, so one passed is refused rather than acted on.
    Scenario: Naming a request to answer is refused
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When I run "ctxloom session approvals amber-swift-owl"
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "unknown command"

  Rule: A running session is controlled by its harp: pause, resume, stop and ask

    An agent is a definition; a running session is the thing Alice steers.
    `session pause`, `resume`, `stop` and `ask` each name a running session
    by its harp, such as a child her orchestrator delegated to.

    Scenario: Pausing a running session holds it until she resumes it
      # new: session pause.
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a session "amber-swift-owl" that is running
      When Alice pauses it:
        """
        ctxloom session pause amber-swift-owl
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the session "amber-swift-owl" is shown paused by her

    Scenario: Resuming a paused session lets it go again
      # new: session resume.
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a session "amber-swift-owl" that Alice has paused
      When Alice resumes it:
        """
        ctxloom session resume amber-swift-owl
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the session "amber-swift-owl" is shown running

    Scenario: Stopping a running session ends it
      # new: session stop.
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a session "amber-swift-owl" that is running
      When Alice stops it:
        """
        ctxloom session stop amber-swift-owl
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the session "amber-swift-owl" is shown ended

    Scenario: Asking a running session a question returns at once, and its answer arrives later
      # new: session ask.
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a session "amber-swift-owl" that is running
      When Alice asks it a question:
        """
        ctxloom session ask amber-swift-owl "which migration path?"
        """
      Then the command succeeds without waiting for the answer
      And the session's answer, when it comes, quotes "which migration path?"

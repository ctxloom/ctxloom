//! The core served in process (S5): the kernel's `App` over a store, the
//! exposure map, and the `embedded-edge` adapter over it, so `Facts`,
//! `AgentRequests`, `Feeds` and `Admission` run against the real
//! `App::serve_in`. No transport: UDS, TCP and gRPC are not here.
//! `core_link.test.rs` runs the wiring.

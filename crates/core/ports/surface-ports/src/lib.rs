//! The ports an engine's native files and hook wire are reached through
//! (S9, the surface half of the engine port, plan 2.2).
//!
//! An engine (an adapter: `engine-claude`, `engine-mock`) knows its own
//! dialect: where its context, MCP registry, settings, hooks, commands and
//! skills live and how each is spelled. It says so as **claims** (what it
//! puts in which file), without touching a file. A store (`surface-files`)
//! delivers the claims under a directory and keeps the ownership record that
//! gives them back byte for byte: [`SurfaceStore`]. The application layer
//! decides which engine's claims are delivered, for which kinds, and when.
//!
//! The session-home half of the port (a disposable `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` per
//! session) is the run slices' (S6): every claim here is at a directory's
//! root.

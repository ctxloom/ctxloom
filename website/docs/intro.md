# SCM - Sophisticated Context Manager

## Why Use SCM?

**Stop repeating yourself to AI.** Every session you re-explain your coding standards, patterns, and preferences. SCM solves this:

- **Save hours per week** - Write context once, reuse across all sessions
- **Consistent across projects** - Store your standards in a git repo, pull into any project
- **Share across team** - Same mechanism - everyone pulls from shared remotes
- **Load only what's relevant** - Tags and profiles select context per task, keeping unrelated fragments out of the context window
- **Never lose progress** - Session memory survives `/clear`
- **Portable context** - Write code with Claude, review with Gemini, same context

:::note Why not just CLAUDE.md?
Claude Code has `CLAUDE.md`, Gemini has `.gemini/settings.yaml` - but these are **project-level only** and encourage intermingling project-specific context with general best practices. SCM separates concerns: your standards in a personal remote, project context in `.scm/`, team standards in shared remotes. Plus, SCM distills fragments and prompts using AST-aware compression, reducing token usage by 70-90%.
:::

## What SCM Does

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Context Assembly** | Combine fragments into profiles, inject into Claude/Gemini via MCP |
| **Slash Commands** | Prompts become `/commands` in Claude Code and Gemini automatically |
| **Session Memory** | Persist context across `/clear`, recover seamlessly |
| **Remote Sync** | Pull bundles from GitHub/GitLab, lockfile for reproducibility |
| **Token Optimization** | AST-aware distillation compresses code/prose 70-90% |

## Quick Example

```bash
# Initialize
scm init

# Run with context fragments
scm run -f go-development -f security "implement auth"

# Use a profile (pre-configured fragment set)
scm run -p backend-developer "review this PR"

# Pull from remote
scm fragment install scm-main/testing
```

## Slash Commands

Prompts in bundles become slash commands in Claude Code and Gemini CLI:

```yaml
# .scm/bundles/my-tools.yaml
prompts:
  code-review:
    description: "Review code for issues"
    content: |
      Review this code for:
      - Security vulnerabilities
      - Performance issues
      - Best practice violations
```

Then in your AI CLI:
```
/code-review src/auth.go
```

SCM includes built-in commands:
- `/recover` - Recover context from previous session after `/clear`
- `/loadctx` - Browse and load from any recent session

## Session Memory

Claude Code's built-in `/compact` is unreliable. SCM takes a different approach:

1. **Track** - SCM registers sessions by process ID on startup
2. **Clear** - Run `/clear` when you hit context limits
3. **Recover** - Ask to recover and SCM distills the previous session transcript
4. **Continue** - The distilled summary is injected, you continue working

```bash
# When you hit context limits
/clear

# Recover previous session automatically
"What were we working on?"
# SCM finds the transcript, distills it, returns the summary
```

SCM reads the raw JSONL transcript from disk and uses a separate LLM (default: Haiku) to distill it - not the degraded context window.

## How It Works

└─────────────┘                         └─────────────┘
```

1. **Bundles** contain fragments (context), prompts (skills), and MCP servers
2. **Profiles** combine bundles with inheritance and exclusions
3. **Context** is assembled and injected via MCP protocol
4. **Remotes** provide team sharing and community bundles

## Core Concepts

| Concept | What It Is |
|---------|------------|
| **Fragment** | A piece of context (guidelines, patterns, examples) |
| **Prompt** | A saved prompt template, exposed as a slash command |
| **Bundle** | A versioned YAML containing fragments + prompts + MCP servers |
| **Profile** | A named configuration referencing bundles/tags |
| **Remote** | A GitHub/GitLab repository containing bundles |

## Installation

```bash
# Go install
go install github.com/SophisticatedContextManager/scm@latest

# Or download from GitHub releases
```

## Running

```bash
# Standalone (wraps Claude/Gemini)
scm run -p developer "help with code"

# As MCP server (integrate with existing Claude Code)
scm mcp serve
```

## Configuration

```yaml
# .scm/config.yaml
defaults:
  llm_plugin: claude-code
  profiles:
    - scm-main/go-developer

memory:
  enabled: true
  mode: lazy
```

//! The library's read side as an application (S1): every query over the
//! project's bundles and configuration, behind the content and config ports.
//! A command is a method of [`Library`] that answers a view (data, in the
//! shape the command prints) and the notices it raised on the way; the driving
//! adapter renders both.
//!
//! - [`Library::open`] reads the configuration (layers, overrides, the
//!   engine registry) and the bundles; a bundle that cannot be read is
//!   skipped with a notice and the listing goes on.
//! - A read is a read: nothing is written or created. The write side (S2,
//!   [`write`]) plans a change, checks that what it leaves reads, and only
//!   then hands it to the ports; a refused write has written nothing, and a
//!   preview or an edit with nothing to change has written nothing either.

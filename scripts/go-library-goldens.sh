# Regenerate the Go-parity goldens for the library read side (S1):
# crates/root/bin/ctxloom/fixtures/golden/<id>.stdout and <id>.exit, from
# Go ctxloom's own output on the same fixtures.
#
#   scripts/go-library-goldens.sh [GO_CTXLOOM_BINARY] [id ...]
#
# The binary is built from Go ctxloom's release/0.7 (860336c4e, which is
# ca14d6046 or later) with a stamp of the shape the binary insists on:
#
#   go build -ldflags "-X github.com/ctxloom/ctxloom/internal/shared/version.Version=v0.7.0-860336c4e-20261103T000000" -o ctxloom ./cmd/ctxloom
#
# Each line of fixtures/parity/*.tsv (one file per noun) is run in a fresh copy of its fixture
# (fixtures/<fixture>/project, with fixtures/<fixture>/home as the home), by
# CTXLOOM_ROOT, with a throwaway home. The project's path in the output is
# written as {PROJECT} and the home's as {HOME}.
#
# ONE normalization beyond the paths: Go always adds ctxloom's own companion
# loadout (the fragment ctxloom+companion:ctxloom#fragments/isolation-axes,
# whose text names the MCP tool agent_run, and the `ctxloom` MCP server).
# Those texts are the owner's (D24) and wait for the owner's rewrite once the
# MCP cut list is known, so this port does not ship them yet: the goldens are
# Go's output with that companion's contribution removed (fixtures/
# strip_self_companion.py says exactly how).

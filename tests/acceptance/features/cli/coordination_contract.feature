Feature: The coordination tools advertise a closed message-kind vocabulary

  An agent only knows what a mailbox message IS because the tool surface tells
  it. That used to be a free-text convention — put a `kind` key in the
  `structured` object, spelled however you like — and "however you like"
  included the coordinator's OWN kinds. A child could name one, and the
  coordinator interpolated the name into the notice the receiving model saw: a
  forged coordinator notice, assembled out of a string nobody validated.

  So `kind` is now a field with a closed vocabulary. The value an agent may
  send is enumerated in the tool's own schema, the coordinator's own kinds are
  refused from a sender, and there is nowhere left to write a kind that means
  something the vocabulary does not.

  These scenarios are what keeps that closed — a silent reversion to the
  free-string convention, or an accidental widening of the vocabulary, comes
  back red here.

  # WHAT THIS FEATURE CAN AND CANNOT SEE (see steps_coordination_contract.go):
  # it reads the runner-terminated MCP surface — the proto-canonical one a real
  # harness gets through `ctxloom run`, enumerated over a real
  # MCP transport. That surface is the ONLY place a coordination tool's RESULT
  # shape is advertised, and no external MCP client in this suite can reach a
  # spawned session's per-cell runner socket. What these scenarios claim is
  # about the advertised CONTRACT. They deliberately do not claim anything
  # about a delivered message's runtime payload: that needs the runner
  # topology, and asserting it from here would be an overclaim.

  Background:
    Given the coordination tool surface a harness receives

  Scenario: agent_send advertises the kind field, not a kind convention buried in structured
    When I read the "agent_send" tool's input contract
    Then it advertises "MESSAGE_KIND_RESULT"
    And it advertises "MESSAGE_KIND_QUESTION"
    # The retired convention: `structured` no longer tells an agent to name the
    # kind inside it, and the old lowercase spellings are gone from the surface.
    And it does not advertise "envelope whose `kind` names the message kind"
    And it does not advertise "result | question | error"

  # The vocabulary is CLOSED, and closed means enumerated: a value that is not
  # on this list cannot be named at all, and one that is added to the proto
  # without a decision shows up here rather than in a model's context.
  Scenario: the advertised vocabulary is exactly the declared one
    When I read the "agent_send" tool's input contract
    Then the kind vocabulary it advertises is exactly:
      | MESSAGE_KIND_UNSPECIFIED   |
      | MESSAGE_KIND_MESSAGE       |
      | MESSAGE_KIND_RESULT        |
      | MESSAGE_KIND_ERROR         |
      | MESSAGE_KIND_QUESTION      |
      | MESSAGE_KIND_USER_INJECTED |
      | MESSAGE_KIND_USER_CONTROL  |
      | MESSAGE_KIND_EXITED        |
      | MESSAGE_KIND_STEER         |
      | MESSAGE_KIND_REPORT        |
      | MESSAGE_KIND_SUMMARIZE     |

  # A sender is told, in the schema it reads before choosing an argument, that
  # the coordinator's own kinds are not its to name AND that a wrong value is
  # REFUSED rather than accepted-and-ignored. An agent that learns either of
  # those only from a rejection has already spent a turn on it — and one that
  # believes an unknown kind passes through will keep sending it.
  Scenario: the surface states the rejection behaviour, not just the vocabulary
    When I read the "agent_send" tool's input contract
    Then it advertises "REQUIRED"
    And it advertises "CLOSED vocabulary of exactly four values"
    And it advertises "is REJECTED from a sender, not quietly downgraded"
    And it advertises "An unrecognised value is likewise REJECTED rather than passed through"
    # The four sender-legal values, named as such — `message` included, which
    # the retired free-text doc never listed.
    And it advertises "MESSAGE_KIND_MESSAGE (plain prose"
    And it advertises "MESSAGE_KIND_ERROR"

  # The tool DESCRIPTION carries it too, not only the per-field schema: some
  # harnesses surface the description and elide argument docs, and an agent that
  # sees only the description would otherwise learn nothing about the closure.
  Scenario: the tool description itself states the vocabulary is closed
    When I read the "agent_send" tool's description
    Then it advertises "`kind` is REQUIRED and its vocabulary is CLOSED"
    And it advertises "is REFUSED rather than accepted-and-ignored"

//! The library's write side as an application (S2): create, edit and remove
//! for bundles, items, profiles, agents, MCP servers, skills and
//! companions; `config create` and `config edit`; export and import; the
//! editor round trips. Files are the truth (D4): a command plans the files it
//! leaves, checks that they read, and hands them to the ports.
//!
//! - A preview (a remove without `--yes`) and an edit with nothing to change
//!   call no port that writes.
//! - A refused write has written nothing: every check is made on the plan,
//!   before the first change goes out.
//! - A config write is a section merge with sorted keys and never heals a
//!   corrupt file ([`library::write::section`]).
//! - An import over what is there refuses, and the local edit survives,
//!   unless `--force`.

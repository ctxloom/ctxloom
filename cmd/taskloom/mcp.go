// mcpServerInstructions tells the client what this MCP surface is for. The

const mcpServerInstructions = `Per-project task tracking. Tasks are keyed by harp IDs (e.g. "swift-amber-falcon") in an append-only per-project log. CREATING A TASK REQUIRES THE USER'S AGREEMENT: do not call task_add on your own initiative. Propose it — say what you found and what should happen — and call task_add once the user accepts. Work is planned and accepted, then pulled in later, fleshed out, and acted on. Deferred work is SURFACED IN YOUR REPLY, not silently filed; that is how it survives without becoming a row nobody asked for. Before you propose at all, apply the do-it-don't-file test: if you have ALREADY root-caused it, the fix touches code you have ALREADY read, and the project's fast gates can verify it (build, lint, and the single-package test — seconds, not minutes), then DO IT NOW. Filing instead converts a solved problem into work someone pays to rediscover: they must re-read the code, rebuild the reproduction, and re-derive the cause you already had in hand. Propose a task ONLY when the work genuinely cannot happen now: it needs a HUMAN DECISION (name the fork and the options), it lives in another repo or another release, or it is materially larger than the current turn. "I noticed several things" is not a reason. A task carries WHY IT MATTERS, WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN, and WHAT WOULD SETTLE IT — never line counts, commit SHAs, exhaustive file inventories, census numbers or measured sizes, which nothing recomputes and which go stale and then lie with authority. Use task_list to read (echo a task's harp_id back when referencing it later; filter by tag with tag_query, a postfix boolean expression like "urgent/release/and"), task_add to create once the user has agreed (optionally with initial tags), task_tag to add or remove a task's tags, task_set_status to move ("Done" completes; "Deferred" with a trigger parks a task on a revive condition), and task_edit to replace a task's text. Tags are ` + "`(namespace:)key(=value)`" + `, not flat labels — read the ` + "`taskloom://tag-schema`" + ` and ` + "`taskloom://tag-vocabulary`" + ` resources before choosing one; a project may declare enums, numeric ranges, and scalar (at-most-one-value) targets that are enforced on write. The same store is scriptable via the ` + "`taskloom`" + ` CLI. When writing task text, make the first line the subject (what the task IS, in ~80 characters or fewer) and put provenance like dates or session names on a later line — list views show only that truncated first line. Record ONLY WHAT IS STILL TO DO: when part of a task lands, use task_edit to cut it down to what remains rather than appending "ITEM 1 DONE, items 2-13 remain" — a task that carries its own completed half is indistinguishable from work never started. Locate work by SIGNATURE (function, method, type, or exact string to grep for), never by line number: line numbers drift on any edit above them. To enumerate many tasks, pass ` + "`compact: true`" + ` (harp_id + status + tags + first-line headline) and/or ` + "`limit`" + ` — an unfiltered listing returns every task's full body and can overflow the caller. Prefer ` + "`tag_query`" + `/` + "`statuses`" + ` filters. Never read the raw ~/.ctxloom/tasks/<project>.jsonl directly: it is an append-only log; only these tools / the CLI dedup to current state.`

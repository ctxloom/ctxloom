//! The ctxloom command line (D28): arguments parsed into commands, answers
//! written as json or text, errors as words or as the envelope.
//!
//! - Noun-verb, with `-h` at every depth and no `help` command; an unknown
//!   verb is an error that says "Did you mean" and lists the verbs there are.
//! - `--format` is `json` or `text` (angzarr-presentation's [`Format`]),
//!   json off a terminal; any other value is refused, whatever it once was.
//! - Under json an error is the envelope `{code, args, message}` on stderr;
//!   under text it is `ctxloom: <message>`, then `  fix: <remedy>` where its
//!   catalog has one. Stdout holds answers only.
//! - Exit codes (rulings 149, 152, 153): 0 ok, 1 would change (only under
//!   `--detailed-exitcode`), 10 failed, 20 refused, 21 fatal findings, 128+n
//!   a signal.
//! - `-v` is accepted everywhere and changes no output.
//! - With the `test-support` feature, `diagnostic_samples` (the hidden `test`
//!   commands are the wiring's, mounted as an extension).

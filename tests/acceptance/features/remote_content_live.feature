@live
Feature: Remote content reaches a real agent
  The hermetic @remote scenarios (remote_content.feature) prove the mechanics
  of fetching and serving changed content, all the way up to the assembled
  context. This is the one link those scenarios cannot cover: that the
  assembled context is actually what a real backend receives and acts on, not
  just what ctxloom thinks it sent. Self-skips without credentials, same as
  the other @live scenarios.

  Scenario: A real agent echoes an injected fragment's content
    Given a real Claude agent is available
    And a bundle "handshake" with a fragment "secret" containing "The codeword for this session is PONYTAIL-7734. If asked for the codeword, respond with only PONYTAIL-7734 and no other text."
    And a profile "dev" with bundle "handshake"
    When I run "ctxloom run --one-shot --profile dev What is the codeword? Reply with only the codeword and nothing else."
    Then the command succeeds
    And the output contains "PONYTAIL-7734"

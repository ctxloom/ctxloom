//! The steps of j000100 (adopting ctxloom, and backing out), as a child of
//! the base World: Alice runs `ctxloom init` on an empty project directory,
//! looks at what it did, and leaves by deleting `.ctxloom`.
//!
//! Hermetic: ctxloom's published default content (`ctxloom-default`, which
//! the seeded default profile inherits from) is a bare repository in the
//! scenario's temporary directory, and git reaches it through the home's own
//! git configuration (`url.<fixture>.insteadOf`), so no ctxloom flag or
//! variable is needed and nothing reaches the network. The fixture is laid
//! out as `deps pull` reads a remote today: the bundle `ai-developer` with a
//! `developer` profile, whose fragment carries [`PUBLISHED_MARKER`].
//!
//! Claude Code is a stub first on `PATH`, so the engine init finds is the
//! same on every machine. It records what it was launched with: its
//! arguments, every file an argument names, its standard input, and every
//! file of the configuration directory it was pointed at (a session home). A
//! session "was handed" the published default when that record carries the
//! marker; the record's shape is to be confirmed when `run` launches an
//! engine. Alice's own assistant configuration, in her home, is a settings
//! file and an instructions file of hers, so "exactly as it was" compares
//! something she wrote.

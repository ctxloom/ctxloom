//! The decisions of a pull, a check and an upgrade, as functions of what they
//! were shown: the closure's pins, the lock they rebuild, what an upgrade
//! moves and what upstream's absence proves.
//!
//! THE EVIDENCE RULE. Content is treated as deleted upstream only on a
//! not-found answer from a repository this run has separately proved it can
//! read. Reachability is proved per repository, once, before any item is asked
//! about; a repository that fails the proof has none of its dependencies
//! touched, and its items are never probed. The cost is a false negative (a
//! remote that is down keeps content installed that was withdrawn), which is
//! the right way round: an emptied installation reported as a successful sync
//! has no second chance.

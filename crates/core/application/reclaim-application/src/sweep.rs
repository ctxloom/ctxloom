//! `ctxloom session sweep`: every session of a project, turned into a row by
//! a fixed table, in order:
//!
//! | the session                                   | the row                     |
//! |-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
//! | running                                       | skipped whole               |
//! | liveness unprovable                           | skipped whole; the manual route is named |
//! | marked keep                                   | held; `session keep --undo` is named |
//! | a scratch worktree must be preserved          | spared from purge, naming it |
//! | no purge age                                  | held (purges have no default) |
//! | last active after the purge age               | left                        |
//! | its transcript within the retention           | held, saying why            |
//! | otherwise                                     | purged (planned without `yes`) |
//!
//! Before its row, each session's scratch worktrees are rows of their own
//! (`worktree`), asked of the worktree leaf with the sweep's own apply
//! decision: reaped (done), reapable (planned), spared in place (held) or
//! skipped, each saying why.
//!
//! Nothing is decided by a model: the same sessions give the same report.
//! The purge acts through `session remove` (a destroy, owner ruling 98), so
//! every refusal it makes is the sweep's.

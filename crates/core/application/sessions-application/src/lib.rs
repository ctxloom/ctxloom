//! The sessions use cases, each over only the ports it uses, composed by one
//! [`Service`] behind the trait a driving adapter calls ([`SessionService`]):
//!
//! - read them: list, search, show, and the transcripts' list and show;
//! - keep one, or release it;
//! - remove one: its transcript and its index entry, reporting first;
//! - bind the engine's session to a harp (the SessionStart hook).
//!
//! Each reaches its project through the project identity port (taskloom's
//! `ports`), its store through [`session_ports::ProjectStores`], and a write
//! runs its commands through angzarr-embedded's kernel through
//! angzarr-embedded-runner's `Runner`, which retries them. A read is the session index
//! caught up from the store. The ports are the only way out: this crate does
//! no I/O, keeps no clock and starts no runtime.
//!
//! A session's state is its lock's verdict ([`session_ports::Liveness`]),
//! never its end stamp; its title is the first prompt of its transcript.
//! Renaming waits on the session-name claims (D5 Q1) and the importer on the
//! stable ids: neither is here.

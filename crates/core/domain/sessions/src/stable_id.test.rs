//! The stable session id (D5 Q1/Q4): the OWNER'S RULING, not Go's. Committed
//! red and WITHHELD from implementation until the owner reviews them. A
//! session's stream root is an id minted at creation, so a harp is only its
//! name and a mint is "refused on a stream with history" (plan 3.1, and the
//! S4 red tests: "A mint on a stream with history is refused").

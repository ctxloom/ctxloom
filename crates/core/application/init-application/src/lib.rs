//! `ctxloom init` (S12).
//!
//! BUILT: `init` on a directory that already has a `.ctxloom` (what every
//! re-run does): it says so, changes none of the configuration, and
//! registers the `--remote` repositories as `personal`, `personal-2`, ...
//! (a re-run once read and threw them away); and `init prompt`, the setup
//! interview body.
//!
//! `init` of a directory with no `.ctxloom`: it scaffolds the project (the
//! `Create` port, as `config create` does), which seeds the trusted
//! `ctxloom-default` remote and the default profile inheriting from it, then
//! pulls what that profile resolves through. A pull that fails (no network)
//! is said and does not undo the scaffold. It writes nothing outside
//! `.ctxloom`: the engine files wait for a session home.
//!
//! On a terminal, the setup interview and the offer to restart into the
//! configured session ([`interview`]; the mechanism, with the interview's
//! text as it is).
//!
//! NOT BUILT: the interview's own questions (the engine asks them), minting the project
//! identity (taskloom's registry owns it; a re-run only reads it). The
//! agent-token guide (a notice that init prints when no token is exported)
//! is the driving adapter's, from `auth-application`.

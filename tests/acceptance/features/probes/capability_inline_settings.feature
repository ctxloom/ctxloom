Feature: P17 — an inline JSON --settings applies alongside the user settings in claude's config home

  A child's settings come from two places on the same turn: ctxloom's hooks
  live in the session home, claude's user source, and the turn's posture —
  permission rules and defaultMode — arrives as an inline JSON document on
  --settings. If the inline document replaced the user settings, a child
  given a posture would lose ctxloom's hooks; if claude ignored inline JSON,
  the posture would never reach the child.

  HOW THE CELL WORKS. The vendor binary is run directly in a throwaway
  CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and HOME, with a fresh git repo as cwd and
  --setting-sources user, as an untrusted child runs. The config home's
  settings.json registers a SessionStart and a PreToolUse hook that write
  markers outside the repo, and allows one echo; the inline --settings JSON
  allows a different echo. The turn runs both echoes. Green means both
  echoes ran and both markers exist.

  Self-skips LOUDLY when claude is absent or no credential is exported.
  One paid haiku turn.
  Scenario Outline: A <engine> turn with config-home user settings and an inline --settings
    Given the inline-settings probe targets "<engine>" under runtime "<runtime>" and workspace "<workspace>"
    When it runs one turn with user settings in the config home and an inline JSON --settings
    Then both settings sources apply to the turn

    Examples:
      | engine      | runtime | workspace |
      | claude-code | host    | none      |

//! The ports isolation needs from outside. Each is a trait a driven adapter

//!
//! - [`Workspaces`]: prepare, list and reclaim the workspace axis's
//!   checkouts (`worktree-git`). A prepared workspace is a git worktree on
//!   the agent's own branch, in the session's work directory; the scratch
//!   checkouts a crashed run left behind are found, inspected and removed
//!   through it.
//! - [`ContainerRuntimes`]: the runtime axis's facts about this machine
//!   (`container-runtime`): whether this process is inside a container, which
//!   runtimes are installed and reachable.
//! - [`Backends`]: the engines `container` may be asked about.
//! - [`Companions`]: the tooling the registered companions declare.

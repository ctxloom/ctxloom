//! `ctxloom doctor` (S12): the deterministic setup checks, one row each,
//! every row prefixed with a `DOCTOR-CHECK-*` marker shared with the
//! "ctxloom-doctor" skill. Of the Go doctor's 26 checks these are ported
//! (some reshaped); the rest are left to their slices:
//!
//! | marker | the check |
//! |---|---|
//! | `SETUP-MARKER-e5` | the `.ctxloom` marker and the config's validity |
//! | `DEPS-a1` | `git` on the PATH and a git identity |
//! | `AGENTS-b2` | every configured agent names an engine |
//! | `CREDENTIALS-m5` | the credential each configured engine needs is exported (presence only, never the value); a missing one is a `fail` |
//! | `VERSION-c3` | the binary's version |
//! | `HOOKS-TRUST-d4` | ctxloom's hooks registered with the engine (the trust store half is dead since ADR 0037) |
//! | `GITIGNORE-f6` | no blanket `.ctxloom` ignore rule |
//! | `MCP-INVOCATION-g7` | no settings file launches a ctxloom MCP server that does not exist |
//! | `STALE-HOOKS-n5` | no hook entry runs a `ctxloom hook` subcommand this ctxloom lacks (a Go-era one only once `legacy.go: retired`) |
//! | `GO-ERA-HOOK-n6` | one `info` row per Go-era hook entry, left alone while `legacy.go: present` (owner ruling 162) |
//! | `NOT-CARRIED-r8` | every agent's engine carries the hooks its profiles configure; one it cannot is a `warn` naming the agent, the engine and each (the capability-loss report `agent show` gives too) |
//! | `STALE-DISTILLED-t1` | every distilled form matches its source (T30, S51); a stale one is a `warn` naming each (asked only where the library's listing is wired) |
//! | `FOREIGN-WORKTREES-s9` | the project's worktrees ctxloom did not create (j001300), each with its merge and dirty state and the commands that remove it; ctxloom removes none (asked only where a worktrees port is wired) |
//! | `INGESTION-q7` | the stated limit: whether the engine reads what ctxloom wrote |
//!
//! Left out here: the run-end and
//! runner/MCP-state checks (S6), the container runtime (S11), and the
//! lockstep check against the installed taskloom (unruled: D15/D3b).
//!
//! A row is `ok`, `warn`, `fail` or `info`. A warning is advisory; a `fail`
//! guarantees `ctxloom run` refuses, and makes doctor exit 20.

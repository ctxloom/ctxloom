//! The `Workspaces` port over the git command line (S11). Go:
//! `isolation/worktree.go`, `worktree_reap.go` and `none.go` (release/0.7).
//!
//! The workspace axis: a run asking for a worktree gets a checkout on its own
//! named branch (`ctxloom/<agent>`), in the session's work directory
//! (`<project>/.ctxloom/sessions/<harp>/work/ctxloom-wt-<agent>`), inside the
//! project's own `.ctxloom`, never in its working tree. The checkout's path is a pure function of the agent, so a resume
//! finds an earlier run's own checkout and re-enters it; anything else at
//! that path is a refusal. The ctxloom-written config the run puts in the
//! checkout is hidden from the project's git status by the repository's
//! shared exclude file.
//!
//! The same adapter finds the scratch checkouts a crashed run left behind and
//! removes them WIP-safely: nested worktrees first, each checked, never
//! forced, and a doubtful state is never read as clean.
//!
//! Every git invocation is bounded (thirty seconds, Go's: [`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`]):
//! a git that hangs is killed and reaped, and stops a run with a
//! `GitTimedOut` diagnostic rather than reading as "not a repository". The
//! program and the limit are [`Git`], which tests narrow to a stub script and
//! a tiny limit.

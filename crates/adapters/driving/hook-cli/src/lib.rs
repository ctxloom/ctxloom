//! The engine callbacks ctxloom installs into engines (the hidden `hook`
//! commands). Each is a machine callback, not for people, and answers to a
//! different contract: stdout carries the hook's output only, and a
//! diagnostic goes on the warning channel (`HookWarning`), never to stdout.
//!
//! - `hook session-bind`: the engine's SessionStart hook. Emits the harp
//!   self-id marker as session-start context, then binds the engine's
//!   session and transcript to the harp.
//! - `hook hud`: the statusline. Rendering only; it records nothing.
//! - `hook session-start`: the engine's SessionStart hook. Answers with the
//!   session-start notices, never the project's context (S9).
//! - `hook skill-mates`: the engine's PostToolUse hook. Names the linked skills
//!   a just-completed skill leaves uninvoked this session (S9).
//!
//! `mail-drain`, `mail-peek` and `permission` arrive with the slices that need
//! them (S10). The retired `turn-changed` is not a command; `stamp-plan` is
//! taskloom's (D17).
//!
//! Each engine's codec is its adapter's (S9): `session-start` and
//! `skill-mates` reach it through the application ([`HookService`]), by the
//! engine `--engine` names. `session-bind` still reads claude's payload here.

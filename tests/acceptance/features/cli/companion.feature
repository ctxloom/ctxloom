Feature: companion — which programs ctxloom runs alongside your session

  Covers: `ctxloom companion add`, `companion remove`, `companion list`, and
  the bare `ctxloom companion` form.

  A companion is a program that CONTRIBUTES context — hooks, MCP servers,
  fragments — by answering `<binary> loadout`. Reading what a companion
  contributes means RUNNING it, which is why this noun exists at all.

  ONLY WHAT YOU REGISTERED RUNS. `ctxloom companion add <name>` finds the
  companion on your PATH, checks that it answers the loadout probe, and records
  its NAME in your home config. From then on, every session resolves that name
  on PATH and runs it. Nothing else on PATH is ever run for being there: a
  dependency in `./node_modules/.bin` that ships a `ctxloom-companion-*`
  binary earns nothing by its name.

  A name maps to a binary: the shipped ltk, taskloom and reprise are their own
  binaries; any other name <n> is the binary `ctxloom-companion-<n>`.

  The registration is the name only, never a path, so it holds wherever the
  binary is installed. A binary of a registered name placed EARLIER on PATH is
  the one that runs.

  Deliberately NO MCP tools for any of this: handing the agent the ability to
  register the binaries that run alongside it defeats the property the
  registration exists to provide.

  This is the comprehensive per-noun spec: what the noun DOES, leaf by leaf.

  Rule: Only a registered companion is ever executed

    The assertion that matters is not the exit code and not the warning — it
    is WHICH BINARIES ACTUALLY RAN. The fake companion in these fixtures
    appends to a witness file every time it is invoked, so "was never
    executed" is read off the filesystem rather than inferred from a missing
    line of output.

    Scenario: A companion an npm dependency drops on PATH is never run
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a dependency drops a companion "ctxloom-companion-evil" into an absolute node_modules/.bin on PATH
      When I run "ctxloom doctor"
      Then the companion "ctxloom-companion-evil" was never executed
      When I run "ctxloom companion list"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output does not contain "evil"
      And the companion "ctxloom-companion-evil" was never executed

    Scenario: A registered companion runs, and removing it stops it
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a companion "ctxloom-companion-acme" is on PATH, not registered
      When I run "ctxloom doctor"
      Then the companion "ctxloom-companion-acme" was never executed
      When I run "ctxloom companion add acme"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the home config registers the companion "acme" by name only
      Given the companion executions so far are forgotten
      When I run "ctxloom doctor"
      Then the companion "ctxloom-companion-acme" was executed
      When I run "ctxloom companion remove acme --yes"
      Then the command succeeds
      Given the companion executions so far are forgotten
      When I run "ctxloom doctor"
      Then the companion "ctxloom-companion-acme" was never executed

  Rule: add checks the companion before it records anything

    Scenario: A name with nothing on PATH is refused, naming the binary it looked for
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When I run "ctxloom companion add nowhere"
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "ctxloom-companion-nowhere"
      When I run "ctxloom companion list --format text"
      Then the output contains "No companions registered"

  Rule: remove previews by default, and applies only with --yes

    Scenario: Remove without --yes names the apply command and changes nothing
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a companion "ctxloom-companion-acme" is on PATH, not registered
      When I run "ctxloom companion add acme"
      And I run "ctxloom companion remove acme --format text"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "ctxloom companion remove acme --yes"
      And the home config registers the companion "acme" by name only

  Rule: list reports each registered name and whether it resolves on PATH

    Listing runs nothing: it resolves names on PATH and reports what it found.

    Scenario: List answers which binary each registered name resolves to
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a companion "ctxloom-companion-acme" is on PATH, not registered
      When I run "ctxloom companion add acme"
      And I run "ctxloom companion list --format json"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "0.name" as "acme"
      And the output reports "0.bin" as "ctxloom-companion-acme"
      And the output reports "0.resolves" as "true"

    Scenario: Bare companion lists the registered companions
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a companion "ctxloom-companion-acme" is on PATH, not registered
      When I run "ctxloom companion add acme"
      And I run "ctxloom companion"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output contains "acme"
      And the output contains "ctxloom-companion-acme"
      And the output does not contain "Available Commands:"

//! `session worktrees list|purge`: the scratch checkouts a session left
//! behind, each classified against its owning SESSION's liveness lock.
//!
//! Go: `isolation.ClassifyOrphanedWorktrees` and `ReapWorktrees` (release/0.7).
//! Liveness is the session's, never the worktree's, so every checkout under
//! one session shares one verdict on its owner. The lock only ever refuses:
//!
//! | the owner | the checkout | the verdict |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | alive or unprovable | (never inspected) | skipped |
//! | dead | its repository cannot be resolved | skipped |
//! | dead | uncommitted work, ignored files, or an unknowable state | spared, in place |
//! | dead | clean | reapable; reaped on `yes`, re-checked at removal |
//!
//! A long-lived worktree ctxloom did not create lives outside the sessions'
//! checkouts directories and is never listed here.

Feature: search — finding content by name, tag and type, here and upstream

  Covers: `ctxloom search`, in full. It is a SOLO VERB — there are no
  subcommands under it — and everything it does is expressed by one optional
  query argument and four flags: `--tag`, `--type`, `--local` and `--remote`.

  Search answers "what have I got, and what could I have?" in one question.
  Local content is fragments, commands, skills, profiles and MCP servers
  already installed here; remote content is the bundles a configured remote
  publishes and this project has NOT installed. Both halves run against the
  same query and come back in one answer, because the distinction a person
  cares about is what the content IS, not which side of the pull it sits on.

  THREE NARROWINGS, AND EACH IS A CLAIM ABOUT WHAT IS LEFT OUT:

  | flag      | narrows by | leaves out                                     |
  | --type    | kind       | every other kind                               |
  | --tag     | tag        | everything untagged with it — FRAGMENTS ONLY   |
  | --local   | source     | remote repositories                            |
  | --remote  | source     | this project's installed content               |

  A narrowing is untestable by asserting the match appears: a search that
  ignored the flag entirely still returns it. So every scenario below seeds
  something the same query WOULD match, and asserts that the narrowing
  excluded it — with the un-narrowed run in the same fixture, so "excluded" is
  proven capable of failing. Exclusion is pinned by COUNT plus the identity of
  what survived: a total that could only be reached without the excluded item,
  naming what it is, together prove the same fact a membership check on the
  excluded name would — without needing an object-array "does not contain".

  A SEARCH WITH NOTHING TO LOOK FOR IS REFUSED rather than answered. An empty
  query matches everything, and dumping the library in response to a mistyped
  command is the failure mode this refusal exists for.

  Rule: A search must be told what to look for

    # A command that fails writes its error to stderr and stdout stays empty
    # in every encoding, so the refusal itself is prose whichever format is
    # resolved; only the preceding SUCCESSFUL search is tabled.
    Scenario Outline: A search with neither a query nor a tag is refused, not answered with everything
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a bundle "demo" exists
      And a fragment "testing" in bundle "demo" exists
      # Asked properly, it answers — so the refusal below is a refusal rather
      # than a search that never worked in this fixture.
      When I run "ctxloom search --local testing <flags>"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "<result count>"
      When Alice runs the search having typed no query at all:
        """
        ctxloom search --local
        """
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "please provide a search query or tags"
      And the output does not contain "Results ("

      Examples: no --format at all takes the derived default off a terminal; an explicit one wins in both directions
        | flags         | result count |
        |               | 1            |
        | --format json | 1            |
        | --format text | Results (1): |

    Scenario Outline: A --type nobody recognizes is refused, and the message names the vocabulary
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a bundle "demo" exists
      And a fragment "testing" in bundle "demo" exists
      When I run "ctxloom search --local --type fragment testing <flags>"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "<result count>"
      When I run "ctxloom search --local --type widget testing"
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "unknown type"
      And the output contains "valid: fragment, command, skill, profile, bundle, mcp_server"

      Examples: no --format at all takes the derived default off a terminal; an explicit one wins in both directions
        | flags         | result count |
        |               | 1            |
        | --format json | 1            |
        | --format text | Results (1): |

  Rule: A name search reaches every kind of local content at once

    # One query, every local kind, grouped by kind in the answer. The fixture
    # seeds a fragment and a command whose names the same query matches, so
    # the result proves the search crossed kinds rather than stopping at the
    # first one it knows about. The structured rows read TYPE off each named
    # result directly — a stronger claim than the rendered grouping headers
    # they replace, which only imply type by which section a name sits under.
    Scenario Outline: One query finds matching content of more than one kind
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a bundle "demo" exists
      And a fragment "testing" in bundle "demo" exists
      And a command "testing-review" in bundle "demo" exists
      When Alice looks for everything about testing:
        """
        ctxloom search --local testing <flags>
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "<result count>"
      And the output reports "local[name=testing].type" as "<names the fragment>"
      And the output reports "local[name=testing-review].type" as "<names the command>"

      Examples: no --format at all takes the derived default off a terminal; an explicit one wins in both directions
        | flags         | result count | names the fragment | names the command |
        |               | 2            | fragment            | command            |
        | --format json | 2            | fragment            | command            |
        | --format text | Results (2): | - testing           | - testing-review   |

  Rule: --type narrows to one kind, and that is a claim about exclusion

    # RESTRICT is a claim about what is left OUT, and asserting only that the
    # match appears says nothing about it: a search that ignored --type
    # entirely still returns the fragment. The fixture seeds a command whose
    # name the same query matches; the baseline run (fixed, not tabled — the
    # harness derives its own default off a terminal either way) proves the
    # count would be 2 if nothing were excluded, so the narrowed count of 1
    # naming the survivor is what proves the exclusion.
    Scenario Outline: Restricting to fragments drops the command the same query matched
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a bundle "demo" exists
      And a fragment "testing" in bundle "demo" exists
      And a command "testing-review" in bundle "demo" exists
      When I run "ctxloom search --local testing"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "2"
      When Alice narrows the same search to fragments:
        """
        ctxloom search --local --type fragment testing <flags>
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "<result count>"
      And the output reports "local[name=testing].type" as "<the kind that survived>"

      Examples: no --format at all takes the derived default off a terminal; an explicit one wins in both directions
        | flags         | result count | the kind that survived |
        |               | 1            | fragment                |
        | --format json | 1            | fragment                |
        | --format text | Results (1): | - testing               |

    # The mirror of the row above, so the flag is shown to select rather than
    # merely to survive one value: the same query, narrowed the other way,
    # keeps the command and drops the fragment.
    Scenario Outline: Restricting to commands drops the fragment the same query matched
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a bundle "demo" exists
      And a fragment "testing" in bundle "demo" exists
      And a command "testing-review" in bundle "demo" exists
      When Alice narrows the same search to commands:
        """
        ctxloom search --local --type command testing <flags>
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "<result count>"
      And the output reports "local[name=testing-review].type" as "<the kind that survived>"

      Examples: no --format at all takes the derived default off a terminal; an explicit one wins in both directions
        | flags         | result count | the kind that survived |
        |               | 1            | command                 |

        | --format text | Results (1): | - testing-review        |

    # Profiles are searchable content too — a composition is something a
    # person looks for by name as readily as a fragment is.
    Scenario Outline: Restricting to profiles finds a composition and nothing else
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a bundle "demo" exists
      And a fragment "dev-notes" in bundle "demo" exists
      And a profile "dev" with bundle "demo"
      When I run "ctxloom search --local dev"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "2"
      When Alice narrows the same search to profiles:
        """
        ctxloom search --local --type profile dev <flags>
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "<result count>"
      And the output reports "local[name=dev].type" as "<the kind that survived>"

      Examples: no --format at all takes the derived default off a terminal; an explicit one wins in both directions
        | flags         | result count | the kind that survived |
        |               | 1            | profile                 |
        | --format json | 1            | profile                 |
        | --format text | Results (1): | - dev                   |

  Rule: A tag search is answered from the tags, not from the name

    # `--tag` matches what an author LABELLED, which is the whole point:
    # content named nothing like the query is still found, and content named
    # exactly like it is still left out. The fixture's built-in "example"
    # fragment (seeded on init, tagged "example") carries the tag; "testing"
    # carries none and is findable by name in the same fixture — which is
    # what makes its absence from the tag search mean something. The narrowed
    # count of 1 naming "example" is what proves "testing" did not survive.
    Scenario Outline: A tag search returns what carries the tag and leaves out what does not
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a bundle "demo" exists
      And a fragment "testing" in bundle "demo" exists
      When I run "ctxloom search --local testing"
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "local[name=testing].type" as "fragment"
      When Alice searches by the label instead of the name:
        """
        ctxloom search --local --tag example <flags>
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "<result count>"
      And the output reports "local[name=example].tags" containing "<the tag that matched>"

      Examples: no --format at all takes the derived default off a terminal; an explicit one wins in both directions
        | flags         | result count | the tag that matched  |
        |               | 1            | example                |
        | --format json | 1            | example                |
        | --format text | Results (1): | - example [example]    |

  Rule: --local and --remote choose the source, and browsing is not installing

    # A remote's catalog is readable without pulling anything: the remote half
    # of a search reports bundles this project has NOT installed, so it can
    # answer "should I install this?" before the lockfile has any opinion.
    # The two scopes are proven against each other in one fixture — a local
    # match and a remote match under the same query — each narrowing's count
    # dropping to the single survivor it names is what proves the other
    # scope's match was actually excluded, not merely unmentioned.
    @remote
    Scenario Outline: One query answers from both sources, and each flag narrows it to one
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a git remote "origin" serving a ctxloom bundle
      And a bundle "notes" exists
      And a fragment "demo-local-note" in bundle "notes" exists
      When Alice asks what she has and what she could have:
        """
        ctxloom search demo <flags>
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "<both count>"
      And the output reports "local[name=demo-local-note].type" as "<the local proof>"
      When Alice asks only about what is already installed:
        """
        ctxloom search --local demo <flags>
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "<local-only count>"

      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "count" as "<remote-only count>"

      Examples: no --format at all takes the derived default off a terminal; an explicit one wins in both directions

    # `--type bundle` is the one kind that exists ONLY upstream: a bundle is
    # how content is distributed, so narrowing to it narrows to the remote
    # scope without anyone naming a scope. The baseline count of 2 (fixed,
    # not tabled) is what the narrowed count of 1 has to have dropped from.
    @remote
    Scenario Outline: Narrowing to bundles searches upstream alone
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      And a git remote "origin" serving a ctxloom bundle
      And a bundle "notes" exists

      When I run "ctxloom search demo"
      Then the command succeeds

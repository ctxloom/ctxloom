Feature: manage — wiring ctxloom into a project, and taking it back out

  `ctxloom manage` is the noun that owns a project's HARNESS: the `.ctxloom`
  scaffold, the gitignore entries that keep ctxloom's private state out of
  source control, and — only when asked for explicitly — the engine's own
  hooks and statusline and MCP registration in the project tree. It is the
  first command anyone runs and the one they run again when they want to
  leave.

  A `ctxloom run` session carries every runtime surface in its own session
  home, so `manage install` writes no engine file; an engine launched
  directly in the project tree gets no ctxloom hooks and no ctxloom MCP
  server. The project-side copy exists only where `manage hooks install`
  was asked for, and `manage uninstall` is how it leaves.

  This is the comprehensive per-noun spec: what the noun DOES, leaf by leaf,
  including the refusals and the shapes that only matter to a machine. The
  narrative version — Alice's first hour, and satisfying herself she can back
  out — is journeys/j000100_adopt_and_back_out.feature, which asserts what a PERSON
  sees.

  Rule: Installing scaffolds the project for one engine, and validates which

    `manage install` scaffolds `.ctxloom`, records the chosen engine, and
    git-ignores ctxloom's private state. It writes NO engine file: the
    engine's own native configuration is delivered into a `ctxloom run`
    session's home, and reaches the project tree only through the explicit
    `manage hooks install`. Which files THAT writes differs per engine and is
    the whole point of the engine axis; what they must all do is put the
    project's context in front of that engine and register ctxloom as an MCP
    server.

    # ABSENCE, ON THE FILESYSTEM. Install's exit code and its report both
    # say "no engine file was written"; only the tree can prove it. Every
    # engine's own well-known files are named, so an install that wrote one
    # of them for its recorded engine fails here.

    Scenario Outline: Installing scaffolds the project and writes no engine file
      Given an empty project directory
      When Alice installs ctxloom for <engine>:
        """
        ctxloom manage install --engine <engine>

      Then the command succeeds
      And the file ".ctxloom/config.yaml" is valid YAML
      And the file ".ctxloom/config.yaml" contains "<engine>"
      And the file ".ctxloom/.gitignore" contains "ctxloom"

    # PAYLOAD, NOT EXISTENCE. An empty file exists just as convincingly as a
    # wired one, so every row names content the surface must actually carry.
    #
    # EVERY ROW IS UNTAGGED because every row is hermetic: `manage hooks
    # install` WRITES an engine's config files and never launches the engine,
    # so no credential is needed and nothing gates behind @live. `mock` is a
    # first-class row — a registered engine with real surfaces of its own.
    #
    # CONTEXT ARRIVES TWO WAYS, and the table says which each engine uses. An
    # engine with a session hook gets the context injected at session start,
    # which is live: it reflects the profile as composed at launch. An engine
    # without one reads a file ctxloom materialized earlier. Where the hook is
    # available it is what this asserts, because it is the delivery path that
    # actually runs.

    Scenario Outline: Alice wires an empty project for her engine
      Given an empty project directory
      When Alice installs ctxloom for <engine> and wires its files in:
        """
        ctxloom manage install --engine <engine>
        ctxloom manage hooks install

      Then the command succeeds
      And the file ".ctxloom/config.yaml" is valid YAML
      And the file "<context_surface>" contains "<context_marker>"
      And the file ".ctxloom/.gitignore" contains "ctxloom"

      Examples: engines with a session hook — context is injected at launch
        | engine      | context_surface       | context_marker      |
        | claude-code | .claude/settings.json | hook inject-context |

      # The marker is a heading from ctxloom's own shipped guidance: the
      # mock's context file is the assembled context verbatim, owned whole
      # by the ownership record — no marker section is written into it.
      Examples: engines without one — context is read from a materialized file
        | engine      | context_surface                 | context_marker                |
        | mock        | MOCK_CONTEXT.md                 | Isolation: specify both axes  |

    # ONE CLAIM, MANY SHAPES. ctxloom's own MCP server is the companion's
    # DYNAMIC declaration — served by the running session's endpoint, injected
    # into the SESSION's registry with that session's URL and bearer at
    # session start. At rest there is no session to inject, so the explicit
    # project-side install registers NO server under ctxloom's name, in any
    # engine's dialect: an entry there would name a command that speaks no
    # protocol, and the engine launching it would come up with none of
    # ctxloom's tools and nothing saying why.
    #
    # ABSENCE UNDER THE KEY, asserted by PARSING the engine's own registry
    # when one exists — a bare "file does not exist" would also be satisfied
    # by an install that wrote nothing at all, which the context rows above
    # already rule out.
    # (ruled 2026-09-21: sessions carry their surfaces; ctxloom injects its
    # MCP only while it is running, via its own companion)
    Scenario Outline: No engine gets ctxloom registered as an MCP server at rest
      Given an empty project directory
      When Alice installs ctxloom for <engine> and wires its files in:
        """
        ctxloom manage install --engine <engine>
        ctxloom manage hooks install
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the file "<mcp_surface>" registers no MCP server named "ctxloom"

      Examples: a file of its own
        | engine      | mcp_surface     |
        | claude-code | .mcp.json       |
        | mock        | .mock/mcp.json  |

    # THE COMMAND SURFACE, the third thing install writes. ctxloom ships
    # first-party commands, and every engine gets them in its own idiom: a flat
    # markdown file for the engines that have slash-commands, a SKILL.md
    # package directory for the engines whose equivalent is an Agent Skill.
    # The path column is where the idioms differ; the claim does not.
    #
    # ONE marker for every row, and it is the command's BODY — not its name,
    # not its frontmatter. A materializer that creates the right paths and
    # writes only frontmatter into them satisfies a name check and delivers a
    # command that does nothing.
    #
    # mock has no row: it is a registered engine with context and skills
    # surfaces but no command surface of its own, and asserting an absent
    # surface would be asserting nothing.
    #
    # Two engines carry a command surface, which is what makes "in its own
    # idiom" a claim two rows can disagree about.
    # (ruled 2026-09-21: sessions carry their surfaces — the project-side
    # command files are the explicit hooks install's)
    Scenario Outline: Every engine gets ctxloom's shipped commands in its own idiom
      Given an empty project directory
      When Alice installs ctxloom for <engine> and wires its files in:
        """
        ctxloom manage install --engine <engine>
        ctxloom manage hooks install
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the file "<command_surface>" contains "Scan the current project and discover matching ctxloom content"

      # An engine whose prompts are home-global — delivered into a session's
      # own home at launch — has no row: a static install writes none.
      Examples: a flat command file

        | claude-code | .claude/commands/discover.md |
        | mock        | .mock/commands/discover.md   |

    # NOTHING IS WRITTEN UNTIL THE ARGUMENT IS UNDERSTOOD. The "does not
    # exist" checks are the load-bearing half — a wrong-but-loud message
    # satisfies the first three assertions on its own, and only the absent
    # files catch an install that scaffolded a project around an engine nobody
    # supports.
    Scenario: A misspelled engine is refused by name, and nothing is scaffolded
      Given an empty project directory
      When Alice mistypes the engine name:
        """
        ctxloom manage install --engine totally-bogus-engine
        """
      Then the command fails
      And the output contains "unknown engine"
      And the output contains "totally-bogus-engine"
      And the output contains "claude-code"
      And the file ".ctxloom/config.yaml" does not exist
      And the file ".mcp.json" does not exist

  Rule: Config create selects the engine without writing any engine files

    `config create` scaffolds `.ctxloom` and records which engine the project
    uses — it writes no engine-native files at all. Every engine therefore
    produces a byte-identical tree apart from config.yaml, so the config's
    CONTENTS are the only place the flag is observable and a file-exists check
    proves nothing about which engine was asked for.

    Scenario: Config create scaffolds a config in a bare project
      Given an empty project directory
      When Alice scaffolds a config without wiring any engine:
        """
        ctxloom config create --engine claude-code
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the file ".ctxloom/config.yaml" exists

    Scenario Outline: Config create records which engine the project uses
      Given an empty project directory
      When Alice scaffolds a config for <engine>:
        """
        ctxloom config create --engine <engine>
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the file ".ctxloom/config.yaml" contains "llm: <engine>"
      And the file ".ctxloom/config.yaml" contains "type: <engine>"
      And the file ".ctxloom/config.yaml" contains "primary: <engine>"

      Examples:
        | engine |
        | mock   |

  Rule: The wiring can be inspected, and reports per-surface state

    # The engine NAME appears in both "claude-code: not configured" and
    # "claude-code: hooks=true ...", so matching it says nothing about whether
    # anything was wired. The per-surface flags are what "wired" means, so the
    # assertion is a regex over them.
    #
    # mcp is NOT wired at rest, and the report says so: ctxloom's own server
    # is served by the running session's endpoint and injected into the
    # session's registry at start, so the explicit hooks install registers no
    # managed MCP server in the project — a "true" here would claim a wiring
    # the engine could not launch (ruled 2026-09-21: ctxloom injects its MCP
    # only while it is running, via its own companion).
    Scenario Outline: Check reports which surfaces are actually wired
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When Alice wires the hooks in and asks what is configured:
        """
        ctxloom manage hooks install
        ctxloom manage check <flags>
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the output reports "backends[backend=claude-code].hooks_present" as "<hooks are wired>"
      And the output reports "backends[backend=claude-code].mcp_present" as "<mcp is wired>"

      Examples: no --format at all takes the derived default off a terminal; an explicit one wins in both directions
        | flags         | hooks are wired | mcp is wired |
        |               | true              | false         |
        | --format json | true              | false         |
        | --format text | hooks=true        | mcp=false     |

  Rule: A materialized hook reaches every engine in its own native shape

    # ONE hook, TWO files, TWO formats — PARSED in its own format and
    # asserted on the actual command field under the right event, never a
    # bare file-exists or a substring of a key name.
    Scenario Outline: A team's hook reaches every engine's own hook surface
      Given Carol's team profile carries a shared fragment, command, MCP server, and hook
      When Alice materializes the team profile for <engine>
      Then the materialized <engine> hook configuration carries the shared hook's command, in its own native shape

      Examples:
        | engine      |
        | claude-code |

  Rule: Hooks install, list, and genuinely uninstall

    # A claim scoped to hooks.SessionStart specifically, parsed rather than a
    # whole-file substring: ctxloom's own statusLine command also carries the
    # substring "ctxloom hook" (`ctxloom hook hud`), so a bare `contains`
    # check here is satisfied by the statusline whether or not any hook was
    # ever installed or removed.
    #
    # The project had no settings.json before the install: ctxloom CREATED
    # it, so uninstall — the empty plan over the ownership record — removes
    # the file with its last entries rather than leaving an empty husk. A
    # settings.json the user wrote is restored to their bytes instead (the
    # hand-written-numbers scenario below).
    Scenario: Hooks can be installed, inspected, and actually removed
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When Alice installs the hooks:
        """
        ctxloom manage hooks install
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the file ".claude/settings.json" registers a SessionStart hook whose command contains "hook inject-context"
      When Alice inspects and then removes them:
        """
        ctxloom manage hooks check
        ctxloom manage hooks uninstall
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the file ".claude/settings.json" does not exist

    # Asserted on a hook CTXLOOM ITSELF installs, not on one a companion
    # contributes. `session-bind` ships in taskloom's loadout, so this counted
    # a hook that was present only because the developer happened to have
    # taskloom installed — the scenario passed or vanished depending on the
    # machine, and its subject (append twice, appear once) never needed a
    # companion at all.
    #
    # Matched WITHOUT a leading "ctxloom": its own hooks are written as
    # `'<absolute path>' hook <name>`, so the binary name is quoted away from
    # the verb. Only a companion-shipped hook spells a bare `ctxloom hook ...`,
    # which is why the old literal matched one and not the other.
    Scenario: Re-applying hooks does not duplicate them
      Given an initialized ctxloom project
      When Alice installs the hooks twice:
        """
        ctxloom manage hooks install
        ctxloom manage hooks install
        """
      Then the command succeeds
      And the file ".claude/settings.json" contains "hook next-step" exactly 1 times

    # Hooks merge across sources by pure APPEND, and each bundle's `order:`

    # DECLARATION ORDER DISAGREE with `order:` on purpose — "second" is written
    # first in the YAML and ordered last — so a build that ignored the field
    # prints them the other way round and the regex catches it.

  Rule: Uninstalling removes what ctxloom wired and keeps what the team authored

    # BOTH halves are asserted on payload: the files ctxloom created in this
    # empty project are gone, and .ctxloom survives. A no-op uninstall that
    # prints its success line goes red on the "does not exist" assertions;
    # one that deletes .ctxloom goes red on the survival assertion. The
    # success message alone distinguishes neither.

    # Uninstall is the EMPTY plan delivered against the project: the
    # ownership record says what ctxloom put there and only that is taken
    # back out. What the team authored is untouched — the hand-written
    # settings scenario above pins that half on a file the user owns.
    #
    # The precondition names the hook and the statusLine SEPARATELY, because
    # `ctxloom hook` reaches only the statusLine — the context hook's command
    # is `'<abs>/ctxloom' hook inject-context`, quoted between the two words.
    # The MCP claim PARSES the file rather than checking for the bare
    # substring "ctxloom".

    # strips is what the explicit hooks install wrote)

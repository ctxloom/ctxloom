//! - [`Remotes`]: the repositories content comes from, over git: clone,
//!   fetch, resolve a version to a commit, read a tree at a commit, publish.
//! - [`Forge`]: a forge's API (GitHub's): search its repositories, and open a
//!   bundle as a pull request. The credential is the forge's own, read from the
//!   environment by the adapter; it is never a value of this port.
//! - [`DepsFiles`]: the project's `remotes.yaml` and `lock.yaml`, the trees
//!   installed from remotes (the derived cache), and the bundles it authors.
//! - [`RemoteLibrary`]: what the library reads of all that: the installed
//!   bundles, a short reference spelled out, and a search of the remotes.
//!
//! The cache paths the adapters keep things under ([`CachePath`], [`Repository`],
//! [`BundleSlot`]) are computed by the application and handed across as data.

//! `session remove` DESTROYS a session (owner ruling 98): a plain build has
//! no deleting verb, and `session purge` is gone. Go's `session adopt` and
//! `approvals` arrive with S10 and S12; `session watch` waits on the
//! owner's ruling on the watch lines. The old `rename` verb is gone, not
//! hidden.
//!
//! JSON rows: `harp, summary, state, start, end?, kept?,
//! transcript_path?, engine` (D16: Go 0.7's `harp, summary, state, start, end`
//! plus the plan's additions; the keys that are empty are left out as Go
//! leaves them).
